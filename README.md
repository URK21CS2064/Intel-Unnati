In the era of 5G and edge computing, the deployment of devices across different locations,has increased, leading to higher power consumption. To adress this issue corporations and governments worldwide have initiated steps to achieve net-zero power consumption. Additionally, the price of electricity is increasing, making it crucial to understand the total power drawn by the system.  

The main objectives of this project include the following -  
    1. Researching and identifying open-source tools for power measurement.  
    2. Identifying and documenting the available knobs in a system to measure power.  
    3. Collect power telemetry data from CPU, memory, NIC, and TDP etc.  
    4. Measure and record system power utilization for CPU, NIC, and TDP based on the input parameter of system utilization percentage.  

## Demonstration of the Project

[Screencast from 2024-07-14 04-22-54.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e010fca8-a9d3-4a9c-9f50-9039a4b36d85)


  
### 1. CPU Metrics:
IT provides real-time monitoring of CPU utilization. It displays the percentage of CPU usage for each individual core, allowing users to see which cores are under heavy load and which are idle. This helps in understanding the distribution of processing tasks across the CPU. C-states (idle states) are various levels of CPU idle modes where parts of the CPU can be powered down to save energy. Our GUI visualizes these states, showing the percentage of time the CPU spends in each C-state.  

**Power Consumption:** The tool also measures the power consumption of both individual cores and the entire CPU package (CPU Cores,Cache Memory,Memory Controller,IGP,IHS, etc). This includes tracking how much power each core is using and the overall power usage of the CPU package, giving insights into energy efficiency and potential areas for optimization.   
  
**Thermal Design Power:** of AMD Ryzen 5 5500U is theoretically 15W which is validated by the TDP Value provided

### 2. RAM and Disk Memory Usage:
monitors the system's RAM usage, displaying the amount of memory currently in use versus available memory. This helps in identifying memory-hungry applications and potential memory bottlenecks.  
  
**Disk Usage:** The tool tracks disk usage statistics, showing the amount of disk space used and available. It provides insights into disk performance and storage capacity, helping users manage their data storage more effectively.

### 3. Temperature Monitoring and Power Mode Switching:
IT tracks the temperature of various system components, including the CPU, GPU, and other critical hardware. It displays real-time temperature readings to help users ensure their system is operating within safe thermal limits.  
  
**Power Mode Switching:** The tool allows users to switch between different power modes, such as performance mode, balanced mode, and power-saving mode. This enables users to optimize their system's power consumption based on their current needs, whether they require maximum performance or extended battery life. 
When the CPU is in a relatively idle state (<10% CPU Utilisation), the different power modes consume the following amount of power-  
  - Power Saving: ~6.2W  
  - Balanced: ~7.1W  
  - Performance: ~8.6W

IT provides detailed battery statistics, including battery percentage, time remaining, and power state (whether the system is plugged in or running on battery). This information helps users manage their battery usage and plan for recharging.
  
**NIC Power Consumption:** The tool monitors the power consumption of the Network Interface Card (NIC), which is crucial for understanding the energy impact of network activities. It helps in optimizing network usage to reduce power consumption.

## Usage Of Docker
 Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside lightweight, portable, self-sufficient <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b8e1cdd-2373-4918-86ab-17667d19fe18" width="120" align="right">containers. Containers include everything needed to run an application: the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and system tools. 
    Using Docker to containerize your Python GUI application ensures a consistent, portable, and isolated environment. This approach helps mitigate dependency conflicts and eases deployment across different systems. By creating a Dockerfile, building an image, and running a container, you encapsulate your application's environment, making it easier to manage and deploy. 

**Steps to Use Docker with Your GUI Application**  
  
**1. Creating a Dockerfile:** This file will describe the environment needed to run within the GUI application.  
**2. Build the Docker Image:** Using the Dockerfile, build a Docker image that contains the application and its dependencies.  
**3. Run the Container:** Start a container from your image which includes input parameters like percentage CPU Loading and Duration to run the container. The Start button on the GUI will execute the Docker container and stress the CPU based on the input parameters, the stop button can be used to terminate the container before completing its duration
    
## Steps To Install 
  
**1. Install All System Dependencies:**

  - Open the *install dependencies* folder in this github repository and download the *"install_dependencies.sh"* file, in your **current working directory**(For ex. Home). Once downloaded execute the following command in your terminal-
```shell
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

  - Now, execute the *"install_dependencies.sh"* file using the following command-  
```shell
./install_dependencies.sh
```

Now your system dependencies are installed.  
  
**2. Install Docker:**

  - Open the *install docker* folder in this github repository and download the *"Step1-install_docker.sh"* file, in your **current working directory**(For ex. Home). Once downloaded execute the following command in your terminal-
```shell
chmod +x Step1-install_docker.sh
```

  - Now, execute the *"Step1-install_docker.sh"* file using the following command-  
```shell
./Step1-install_docker.sh
```

Now Docker is installed, the next step is to create a Dockerfile. Use the command below to create the Dockerfile.    
```shell
vi Dockerfile
```  
  - Open the *install docker* folder in this github repository and copy the contents of *"Step2-Create Dockerfile"* file and paste it in the newly created Dockerfile using the vi editor. Press escape and use **:wq** to save and exit the vi editor.
  - Once done download *"Step3-install stress-cpu.sh"* from the same folder and **save it as "stress-cpu.sh"** , in your **current working directory**(For ex. Home). 
  - Once saved, execute the following command in your terminal-   
```shell
sudo docker build -t stress-cpu .
```

This step may take a few minutes, so kindly be patient while your system finishes building the Docker Image to run the container.   
  
**3. Download Application Code:**

  - If all previous dependencies and Docker have been successfully installed, you are now ready to download and execute application on your system.
  - Open _GUI_code folder and download the file in your, **current working directory**(For ex. Home). 
sudo python3 
```
